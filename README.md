   2. Distance
   3. Run time
3. Training runs will be categorized into common distances: (1 mile, 5 kilometer, 10 kilometer, half marathon, and marathon)  
4. The coach can view runners for selection at a track meet. This will return top runners under the following criterionL
   1. Fastest average pace given a distance category 
   2. Longest mileage completed over training
